# Clap-switch
A clap switch is an electronic device that turns appliances on or off using the sound of claps. It uses a microphone to detect clap sounds, which are then processed by a circuit to trigger a switch. Often used for lights or fans, it's a fun and practical project to understand sound sensors and basic electronics.
